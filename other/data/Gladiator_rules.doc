{\pntxtb (}{\pntxta )}}\pard\plain \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright \fs20\cgrid {As a citizen you have the right to purchase and own gladiators.  So you too can claim all the glory and power that is the victor\rquote s.
\par 
\par "More power! More money! More power! More money!" the debate goes on.  As a the master of a gladiator guild, it up to you to buy and sell you gladiators to either make the most money, or to train the strongest gladiators who dominate all battles.  
\par 
\par Each day a list of all current and new gladiators for sale is posted and through a silent auction bids are taken.  The highest bid win, and a tie will extend the bidding for another day.  Master gladiators who\rquote 
s performance has been demonstrated in battle bring the highest prices, while skinny new slaves just off the ships often can be quite a bargain if you have the means to train 
them, and some times gladiators are overvalued because of recent lucky performance.
\par 
\par As a guild master, it\rquote s your duty to train, arm, and send your gladiators into battles.  As they win, they increase their reputation and skills.  If they lose they learn f
rom their mistakes, and sometimes they pay for those mistakes with their life.  Each time your gladiator uses his skill successfully he has a chance of improving it.  The higher the skill the less room for improvement, so it is easier for a new gladiator 
to improve than a already highly skilled master.
\par 
\par Some of the most exciting battles are when groups of gladiators make teams and fight each other.  Much like a three-ring circus, this gives the audience more to look at and keep the excitement going longer. 
 There is great variety in the types of battles allowed.  Essentially any combination of gladiators may fight any number of other combinations of gladiators.  Each battle must involve two different teams, but the only limit on the number of teams fighting
 
is the arena rules.  Like wise, each team must have at least one gladiator, but there is no limit to the number of gladiators on a team other than the rules of the arena in which they fight.  (ie 50 against 1 is okay, 3 on 3 on 3 on 3 is okay too for some
 areanas.)
\par 
\par Often guild masters have challenge matches with each other to see who has the best gladiators.  But every one is invited to share in the challenges by wagering on their favorite competitor.  A challenge is made by one guild master and is then ei
ther accepted or declined by the challenged guild master.   These matches are often the most exciting of all to watch because they are often the best of the best. 
\par 
\par Gladiators take many risks in battle \ldblquote When you play with knives you\rquote re bound to get cut\rdblquote .  
In some battles the rules will only allow one team to survive.  Still other times a disappointing battle may result in an angry crowd prompting and early demise for the loser.  But careful planning by the guild master can keep his gladiators alive and doi
ng well for a long time.
\par 
\par Gladiators all learn skills to help them in battle and while many of these skills are taught in gladiator school, the only way to master them is to learn in the arena.  In fact some say the gladiator school is best saved to make th
e gladiator into a true master by honing his already highly developed skills to perfection.
\par 
\par In battle you can see your gladiator dodge, block, parry, and hopefully even attack his opponent.  New gladiators often do very poorly, but if they live long enoug
h they learn quickly.  Each time they battle you watch and record how they did using each of their skills.  Often you find a gladiator that is especially adept at a certain skill, and by choosing a battle plan accordingly, you can help your gladiator do h
is best.
\par 
\par When attacking gladiators choose how they will attack, will they attack one opponent at a time, will they divide up they're attacks on many opponents.  Will they try to just hit their opponent in weak spots, or will they just try to hit them even 
as he dodges away.  And when the gladiator\rquote s opponent attacks, he needs to decide to try dodging away, or parrying the attack, or maybe just count on the opponent will miss.
\par 
\par Recently some new styles of fighting have come into play.  Some gladiators have b
een seen recklessly attacking their opponent when they are attacked to keep their opponent from defending, while at the same time dropping their own defenses.  This is a very risky move.  And new weapons are being allowed into some arenas that are designe
d not to hurt their opponent, but to trap and tangle up their weapons so they are more easily defeated.  
\par 
\par Unfortunately not all gladiators are happy about their careers and one hears rumors of escapes.  It is difficult to keep armed slaves and at the same 
time ensure their obedience.  Attempted escapes are not as rare as they should be.  As a guild master you need to decide how to deal with these reprobates.  The law requires that the escapee be put to death, this can be a formal execution, a battle to the
 death usually against lions or unarmed against a fully armored gladiator.  It is not unheard of that a large enough bribe or political contributions can even return your gladiator to battle status.
\par 
\par A rare award granted to a few exceptional gladiators is t
heir "freedom". While this is far from citizenship, these freed slaves can begin a new life and no longer be subjected to a masters will.  This award is often the dream of all slaves, but most will never attain it.  Still as guild master this is a costly 
choice that you can make at your whim.  The occasional freedom of a gladiator often keeps moral high and escapes low.
\par 
\par Gladiator school teaches all the basic skills needed for battle.  And while basic training can make a huge improvement in your gladiator\rquote s
 performance, you will find additional training becomes less and less effective.  Here is where your gladiators will learn the basics of Swordplay, Practical polarms, Clubs, and of course the art of Hand to Hand combat.  For graduation each student perfor
ms his new skills in a small demonstration
 battle, here he will get to uses each skill so you can watch for improvement.  This is the best way to learn your gladiators skills, but after each real battle you will also update your record of his skill that either showed improvement or lack there of.

\par 
\par After each battle you also get a record of your gladiator\rquote s performance.  Only skills actually used in combat will be recorded, otherwise the previous combat performance for that skill will be carried forward.  Gladiator\rquote 
s overall performance is the maximum of both his school record and the most recent battle record.  
\par 
\par As guild master, it is your duty to supply your gladiators with the proper armor and weapons.  You must purchase a supple of these from the market and give
 them to your gladiators.  As the weapons are used in combat they naturally begin to wear out.  On occasion gladiators in combat have their equipment break.  As you can imagine this would be quite upsetting.  How would you like to battle
 a man with a sword when all you have is your bear hands?  It\rquote s important to replace equipment that is wearing out.
\par 
\par Each guild has a plethora of physicians and healers to speed their gladiators on the road of recovery.  In fact every gladiator is restored to perfect health after each battle if he survives.
\par 
\par Sometimes a grudge or feud will develop between two gladiators or two guild masters.  This can be seen when some gladiators will cruelly kill a downed opponent even though he is no longer able to fight.  This practice is 
illegally in most arenas but often unpunished since the crowd enjoys the spectacle.
