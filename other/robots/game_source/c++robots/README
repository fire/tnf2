To use this...

1.  build the combat engine and the sample robots
    % make 

2.  run the combat engine with two or more robots

Trace mode allows you to trace the code as executed by the robots.

    % combat trace ./tracker ./cylon

Watch mode allows you to watch the battle as it occurs.  It requires
a terminal that supports VT100 type escape sequences.  A Warning to 
Sun users...  Use shelltool, not cmdtool.

    % combat watch ./tracker ./target

Match play allows you to specify a number of battles to fight, and 
the results *only* are displayed.

    % combat 5 cylon ./target ./tracker
